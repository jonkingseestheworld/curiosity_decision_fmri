The codes in this repository (the .rmd file) generate the behavioural graphs in the paper, "Shared striatal activity in decisions to satisfy curiosity and hunger at the risk of electric shocks" (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/473975), published in Nature Human Behaviour.

This includes a 'raincloud plot' illustrating the relationship between the level of curiosity/food desirability and participant's risk-take decisions
